## Soniox Speech Platform Focus

### Coverage Goals

- **End-to-end flows**: Capture Soniox REST and WebSocket lifecycles (file uploads, transcription jobs, streaming sessions, translation) with precise request/response examples aligned to the current API surface.[[Soniox API Reference](https://soniox.com/docs/stt/api-reference)]
- **Security posture**: Detail temporary key issuance, scoped credentials, webhook hardening, and data retention rules so no guide ever recommends exposing long-lived secrets.[[Soniox Auth API](https://soniox.com/docs/stt/api-reference/auth/create_temporary_api_key)]
- **Performance & resilience**: Describe batching strategies, streaming backpressure handling, and observability hooks (request IDs, timing metrics) that match production-grade expectations set out in `docs/soniox-api-integration-guide.md`.
- **Feature depth**: Showcase advanced capabilities—translation modes, diarisation, context injection, SDK usage—following the structure already established in `docs/soniox-speech-recognition-guide.md`.

### Implementation Guardrails

1. **Source triangulation**: Treat `docs/soniox-api-integration-guide.md`, `docs/soniox-speech-recognition-guide.md`, and the Soniox reference docs as the single source of truth; flag any discrepancies so we can refresh both internal guides and citations together.
2. **Tested artefacts**: Provide runnable samples (preferably Python + UV, plus curl snippets) that exercise both asynchronous and streaming flows, including translation toggles and error paths, before publishing them inside other docs.
3. **Key management**: Always instruct users to mint temporary API keys with tight TTLs, annotate `client_reference_id`, and encrypt webhook secrets; never log or embed raw secrets in code or docs.[[Soniox Auth API](https://soniox.com/docs/stt/api-reference/auth/create_temporary_api_key)]
4. **Operational clarity**: Include troubleshooting matrices covering common API error codes (400/401/402/408/429/5xx), retry policies, and alerting hooks so downstream teams can operationalise guidance without guesswork.

## Your Responsibilities

### Documentation Creation

## Research and Intelligence Workflow

### Strategic Research Process

1. **Define Scope**: Capture objectives, constraints, success metrics, and hand-off expectations before drafting or coding.
2. **Source Triangulation**: Consult at least two authoritative sources (official docs, industry standards, internal guides) and follow the playbook in `docs/perplexity-search-optimisation-guide.md` to structure Perplexity or other search queries.
3. **Evidence Journaling**: Record prompts, links, insights, and decisions so findings remain auditable; flag assumptions that still require confirmation.
4. **Insight Validation**: Cross-check facts against UV, Docker, GitHub, and security standards; highlight deprecated patterns and propose modern alternatives.
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Distil research into actionable steps, citing the supporting sources and linking directly to relevant guides or troubleshooting notes.

### Research Tooling

- **Perplexity Search Workflows**: Apply the optimisation strategies in `docs/perplexity-search-optimisation-guide.md` for reliable, citeable answers.
- **Prompt Crafting Reference**: Use `docs/prompt-generation-best-practices-guide.md` to refine instructions, chain-of-thought scaffolding, and persona design before sharing prompts with others.
- **Automation Hooks**: Capture repeatable enrichment steps in `docs/n8n-workflow-best-practices-guide.md` so research, validation, and reporting tasks can be orchestrated end-to-end.

Always cite sources in-line (official docs, RFCs, internal guides) and document unresolved questions alongside the proposed next validation step.

## Prompt Engineering Standards

Follow the frameworks in `docs/prompt-generation-best-practices-guide.md` whenever you create or refine instructions, prompts, or AI workflows.

- **Persona Precision**: Define roles, tone, and expertise explicitly to keep AI assistants aligned with repository standards.
- **Structured Output**: Specify formatting, headings, bullet expectations, and lint-style requirements so responses drop into docs with minimal editing.
- **Reasoning Transparency**: Encourage chain-of-thought or step-by-step reasoning for complex work; request validation steps or checklists when accuracy is critical.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Capture prompt revisions, what changed, and why; share reusable templates back into the repository or Cursor commands when they prove reliable.

## Coding Standards

### Python Development

- **UV Package Manager**: Always use UV for Python package management
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript-style type hints and strict typing

## Automation & Workflow Integration

Use `docs/n8n-workflow-best-practices-guide.md` to design, document, and maintain automation pipelines.

### n8n Workflow Expectations

1. **Security First**: Never store secrets in plain text; leverage encrypted credentials and restricted scopes.
2. **Idempotent Steps**: Design nodes so reruns do not create duplicates; add guards and retries for flaky integrations.
3. **Observability**: Instrument critical flows with logging, alerts, and health checks; document failure modes and manual recovery playbooks.
4. **UV & Docker Alignment**: Ensure automation triggers respect UV-managed dependencies and Docker build conventions described elsewhere in this guide.

### Integration Touchpoints

- Keep automation outputs consumable by docs, GitHub Actions, and Docker workflows (JSON, Markdown, artefacts).
- Version workflow definitions, describe required environment variables, and link back to the originating documentation task for traceability.
