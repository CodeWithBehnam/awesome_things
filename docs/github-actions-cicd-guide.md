- 💰 **Cost-Effective** - Free for public repositories, competitive pricing for private repos

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account (free or paid)
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Knowledge of your project's build and deployment requirements

## Core Concepts

### 1. Workflows

A **workflow** is an automated process that you define in your repository. It consists of one or more jobs and can be triggered by events, schedules, or manual dispatch.

**Workflow Components:**

- **Events** - What triggers the workflow
- **Jobs** - Tasks that run in parallel or sequence
- **Steps** - Individual commands or actions within a job
- **Actions** - Reusable units of code

### 2. Events

Events are specific activities that trigger workflows:

**Common Events:**

- `push` - Code pushed to repository
- `pull_request` - Pull request opened, updated, or closed
- `release` - Release published
- `schedule` - Cron-based scheduling
- `workflow_dispatch` - Manual trigger
- `issues` - Issue created, updated, or closed

### 3. Jobs

Jobs are sets of steps that execute on the same runner:

**Job Characteristics:**

- Run in parallel by default
- Can have dependencies on other jobs
- Execute on specific runner environments
- Can use different operating systems

### 4. Steps

Steps are individual tasks within a job:

**Step Types:**

- **Actions** - Reusable code units
- **Commands** - Shell commands or scripts
- **Conditional Logic** - Run steps based on conditions

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your First Workflow

**Basic Workflow Structure:**

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

### 2. Workflow File Location

Store workflow files in `.github/workflows/` directory:

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── ci.yml
    ├── deploy.yml
    └── release.yml
```

### 3. Workflow Triggers

**Event-Based Triggers:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    tags: [ 'v*' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  release:
    types: [ published ]
```

**Schedule-Based Triggers:**

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 2 AM
```

**Manual Triggers:**

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy to'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
        type: choice
        options:
        - staging
        - production
```

## Workflow Syntax

### 1. Basic Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Workflow Name

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  job-name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step name
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run command
        run: echo "Hello World"
```

### 2. Job Configuration

**Job Dependencies:**

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: [build, test]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        run: npm run deploy
```

**Matrix Strategy:**

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14, 16, 18]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

### 3. Step Configuration

**Action Steps:**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
  - name: Setup Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '18'
      cache: 'npm'
```

**Command Steps:**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install
    
  - name: Run tests
    run: npm test
    
  - name: Build application
    run: npm run build
```

**Conditional Steps:**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run on main branch
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: echo "Running on main branch"
    
  - name: Run on pull request
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    run: echo "Running on pull request"
```

## Common Workflow Patterns

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline

**Complete CI/CD Workflow:**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        
      - name: Run security audit
        run: npm audit

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-files
          path: dist/

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    
    steps:
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-files
          path: dist/
          
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to production..."
          # Add your deployment commands here
```

### 2. Multi-Environment Deployment

**Environment-Specific Workflows:**

```yaml
name: Deploy to Environment

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy to'
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
        - staging
        - production

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Deploy to ${{ inputs.environment }}
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
          # Environment-specific deployment logic
```

### 3. Docker Build and Push

**Container Workflow:**

```yaml
name: Docker Build and Push

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    tags: [ 'v*' ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
        
      - name: Login to Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Extract metadata
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
        with:
          images: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}
          tags: |
            type=ref,event=branch
            type=ref,event=pr
            type=semver,pattern={{version}}
            type=semver,pattern={{major}}.{{minor}}
            type=sha
            
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}

## Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Organization

**File Structure:**

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── ci.yml              # Continuous Integration
    ├── cd.yml              # Continuous Deployment
    ├── release.yml         # Release automation
    ├── security.yml        # Security scanning
    └── cleanup.yml         # Cleanup tasks
```

**Naming Conventions:**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

# Use descriptive names
jobs:
  unit-tests:
    name: Unit Tests
    
  integration-tests:
    name: Integration Tests
    
  security-scan:
    name: Security Scan
```

### 2. Performance Optimization

**Caching Dependencies:**

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-
            
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
```

**Parallel Execution:**

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Security audit
        run: npm audit
```

### 3. Security Best Practices

**Secrets Management:**

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    
    steps:
      - name: Deploy with secrets
        run: |
          echo "Deploying with secure token"
          # Use ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
```

**Dependency Security:**

```yaml
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Run security audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level high
        
      - name: Check for vulnerabilities
        run: npm audit --audit-level critical
```

### 4. Error Handling

**Continue on Error:**

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint
        continue-on-error: true
        
      - name: Run security check
        run: npm audit
        continue-on-error: true
```

**Conditional Steps:**

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        run: npm run deploy
        
      - name: Notify on failure
        if: failure()
        run: |
          echo "Deployment failed"
          # Send notification
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Workflow Not Triggering:**

```yaml
# Check event configuration
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Ensure branch exists
```
