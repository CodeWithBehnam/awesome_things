## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Clarity and Specificity

**Principle**: The most effective prompts are clear, specific, and unambiguous.

**Best Practices**:
- Use precise language that eliminates ambiguity
- Specify exact requirements for output format, length, and style
- Include relevant context and constraints
- Avoid vague or overly broad instructions

**Example**:
```
❌ Poor: "Write about AI"
✅ Good: "Write a 500-word technical article explaining how transformer architecture enables large language models to process sequential data, focusing on the attention mechanism and its computational complexity."
```

### 2. Context Provision

**Principle**: Provide sufficient context for the AI to understand the task and generate appropriate responses.

**Best Practices**:
- Include relevant background information
- Specify the target audience and use case
- Provide domain-specific context when necessary
- Include examples or reference materials when helpful

### 3. Structured Instructions

**Principle**: Organise prompts with clear structure and logical flow.

**Best Practices**:
- Use clear separators between different instruction sections
- Employ consistent formatting and structure
- Group related instructions together
- Use numbered lists or bullet points for complex requirements

## Core Prompt Engineering Techniques
