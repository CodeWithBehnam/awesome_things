- **Task-Specific Tools**: Configure which tools are available for each mode
- **Consistent Behaviour**: Ensure predictable responses for specific tasks
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Quickly switch between different AI configurations
- **Team Standardisation**: Share chat modes across team members

### Availability

- **VS Code**: Full support (v1.101+)
- **GitHub.com**: Limited support
- **Other IDEs**: Not currently supported

## Prerequisites

- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- GitHub Copilot subscription
- Basic understanding of Markdown and YAML syntax
- Familiarity with your project's development workflow

## Understanding Chat Modes

### What Are Chat Modes?

Chat modes are specialised AI configurations that define:
- **Persona**: The role and behaviour of the AI assistant
- **Tools**: Which tools are available for the mode
- **Instructions**: Specific guidelines for the AI's responses
- **Model**: Optional AI model specification

### Built-in vs Custom Modes

**Built-in Modes:**

- General-purpose configurations
- Standard chat behaviour
- Basic tool access

**Custom Modes:**

- Project-specific personas
- Tailored tool sets
- Specialised instructions
- Role-based behaviour

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Chat Mode Directory

1. **Create the chatmodes directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/chatmodes
   ```

2. **Verify directory structure:**

   ```
   .github/
   └── chatmodes/
       ├── planner.chatmode.md
       ├── reviewer.chatmode.md
       ├── architect.chatmode.md
       └── security.chatmode.md
   ```

### Step 2: Create Your First Chat Mode

1. **Create a planning mode:**

   ```bash
   touch .github/chatmodes/planner.chatmode.md
   ```

2. **Add the basic structure:**
