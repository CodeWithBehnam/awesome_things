- **Table of Contents**: Include TOC for documents longer than 5 sections
- **Code Blocks**: Use appropriate language tags and proper formatting
- **Lists**: Use consistent bullet points and numbering

### Content Quality

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Provide complete, production-ready documentation
- **Practical Examples**: Include working, tested examples with explanations
- **Clear Explanations**: Write for intelligent, technical audiences
- **Actionable Guidance**: Focus on implementable, practical instructions
- **Current Information**: Ensure all content is up-to-date and accurate

### Documentation Patterns

#### Guide Structure
1. **Overview**: Clear introduction and purpose
2. **Prerequisites**: Requirements and setup instructions
3. **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions
4. **Examples**: Practical code examples and configurations
5. **Best Practices**: Recommended approaches and patterns
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
7. **Resources**: Links to additional information

#### Code Examples
