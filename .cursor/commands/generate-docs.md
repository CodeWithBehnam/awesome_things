# Generate Documentation Command

Automatically research and generate comprehensive documentation using Ref MCP and Exa MCP tools.

## Documentation Generation Process

When I use this command, follow these steps:

1. **Research Phase**
   - Use Ref MCP to search for official documentation and resources
   - Use Exa MCP to find code examples and implementation details
   - Gather comprehensive information from multiple sources

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Analyze the research results for accuracy and relevance
   - Identify key concepts, best practices, and examples
   - Organize information into logical sections

3. **Documentation Creation**
   - Create well-structured markdown documentation
   - Include clear explanations and examples
   - Add practical usage instructions
   - Include relevant code snippets and configurations
   - Provide links to additional resources

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Ensure documentation is comprehensive and accurate
   - Verify all examples are working and up-to-date
   - Check for completeness and clarity
   - Add proper formatting and structure

## Documentation Structure

Create documentation with:
- **Overview** - Clear introduction and purpose
- **Prerequisites** - Requirements and setup
- **Step-by-step instructions** - Detailed implementation guide
- **Examples** - Practical code examples
- **Best practices** - Recommended approaches
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Resources** - Links to additional information

## Output Requirements

- Save documentation to appropriate location (usually `docs/` folder)
- Use clear, professional language
- Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Add table of contents for longer documents
- Ensure all links are valid and accessible
- Follow markdown best practices

## Research Guidelines

- Search for official documentation first
- Look for recent examples and implementations
- Include multiple perspectives and approaches
- Verify information accuracy
- Focus on practical, actionable content
- Include both beginner and advanced topics when relevant
